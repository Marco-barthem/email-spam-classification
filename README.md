# email-spam-classification
A machine learning project using NLP techniques to classify emails as spam or not spam.

This project is part of my learning journey in Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. It is a hands-on exercise based on a YouTube tutorial, which I followed to better understand concepts like text preprocessing, tokenization, count vectorization, and classification models.
